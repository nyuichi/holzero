There is a $100 bounty reward for any problems found in HOL Zero relating to
unsoundness.  The bounty will be awarded per problem to the first person/people
to contact Proof Technologies with a demonstration.  See the README file for
contact details.

QUALIFYING FOR THE REWARD

For something to qualify as an unsoundness problem, it must relate to either an
unsoundness in HOL Zero's logic (design or implementation), or a problem in its
pretty printer that makes it appear that there is an unsoundness in its logic.
The problem must be reproducible and demonstrated by ML source code to be run in
a standard HOL Zero base system session.  The source code must clearly expose
the unsoundness by providing an ML value that gets displayed with ML datatype
'thm' and showing what appears to be an unsound result (given examination of the
theory's assertions).

Note that the bounty will not (or no longer) be paid out for any of the
following known dangerous scenarios:

 - using a non-standard install/build of HOL Zero (e.g. OCaml with parallelism);
 - overwriting key ML objects (e.g. the 'thm' datatype or 'get_all_axioms');
 - overwriting the pretty printer for key ML datatypes (e.g. 'thm' or 'list');
 - circumventing the ML language proper or its type system (e.g. 'Obj.magic');
 - circumventing, reconfiguring or interfering with the implementation of ML;
 - exploiting bugs in the implementation of ML;
 - changing the OS environment in which the implementation of ML runs.

Neither will it be paid out if Proof Technologies are already aware of the
problem or if the latest release of HOL Zero already fixes the problem.

Proof Technologies shall ultimately be the judge of whether an unsoundness has
been uncovered.  All successful bounty claims shall be reported on the Proof
Technologies website.

SUCCESSFUL CLAIMANTS TO DATE

The following individuals have successfully claimed the bounty:

   Martin von Gagern [2010-09-16]
      - for exposing how escape characters can be confusingly displayed in
       certain circumstances

   Carl Witty [2010-09-16]
      - for exposing how 'Obj.magic' can be used to create arbitrary theorems
