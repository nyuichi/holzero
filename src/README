This is the HOL Zero source code directory.

To understand the implementation, start by examining the top-level build file,
'holzero.ml'.  Refer to the glossary, in the HOL Zero documentation directory,
for terminology used in the source code comments.

Note that stepping through 'holzero.ml' needs to be done using HOL Zero's
special version of the OCaml toplevel, called 'hzocaml' and found in the HOL
Zero executables directory, rather than the standard OCaml toplevel 'ocaml'.
For example, if you are using the Xpp GUI then execute the following from a
terminal window from this direcotry:

    > xpp -f holzero.ml -c hzocaml

        *         *         *         *         *         *         *

                             DIRECTORY CONTENTS

This directory consists of the following files:

  FILES          A list of .ml source code files and their descriptions.
  README         This file.
